By day, I work at [atm.com](https://atm.com) on data, backend services & occasionally frontend web.

When time allows, I work on [Sidequery](https://sidequery.dev/), a macOS (and soon cloud!) data analysis and visualization tool & [Sidemantic](https://github.com/sidequery/sidemantic), an accompanying semantic layer.
