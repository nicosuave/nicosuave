#### Professionally
I lead engineering, data & product at [atm.com](https://atm.com)

#### Personally
I work on data tools; some open source & some closed source
  - [Sidequery](https://sidequery.dev/) a macOS (and soon cloud!) data analysis and visualization tool with SQL notebooks & beautiful charts
    - Compatible with Claude Code, Codex CLI & Gemini CLI & your existing AI subscriptions
  - [Sidemantic](https://github.com/sidequery/sidemantic) an complimentary semantic layer for Sidequery to define reusable metrics
    - Supports metrics in LookML, MetricFlow, Cube, Superset, Rill, Omni & Hex formats

##### DuckDB extensions
 - [acp](https://github.com/sidequery/duckdb-acp): an [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) client that exposes a table function & parser extension to support querying with Claude Code, Codex, etc.
 - [poached](https://github.com/sidequery/poached): a utility extension for building IDEs on top of DuckDB
 - [yardstick](https://github.com/sidequery/yardstick): an implementation of Measures in SQL ([arXiv:2406.00251](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00251))
