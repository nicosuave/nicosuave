I lead engineering, data & product at [atm.com](https://atm.com)

I also spend a lot of my time working on on data tools. I aim to open source as much from the Sidequery project as I reasonably can.

_Making analysis more reliable for both humans and machines is my passion!_

- [Sidemantic](https://github.com/sidequery/sidemantic) a multi-format metrics layer for Sidequery (and others!) to define reusable metrics to be used across analysis tools
  - Supports metrics in LookML, MetricFlow, Cube, Superset, Rill, Omni, Boring Semantic Layer & Hex formats
  - Works with DuckDB, MotherDuck, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, ClickHouse, Databricks & Spark SQL
  
- [Sidequery](https://sidequery.dev/): a web & macOS data analysis and visualization tool with SQL notebooks & beautiful charts
  - Compatible with Claude Code, Codex CLI & Gemini CLI & your existing AI subscriptions

##### DuckDB extensions
- [acp](https://github.com/sidequery/duckdb-acp): an [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) client that exposes a table function & parser extension to support querying with Claude Code, Codex, etc.
- [poached](https://github.com/sidequery/poached): a utility extension for building IDEs on top of DuckDB
- [yardstick](https://github.com/sidequery/yardstick): an implementation of Measures in SQL ([arXiv:2406.00251](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00251))
