By day, I work at [atm.com](https://atm.com) mostly on data, backend services & occasionally frontend web.

When time allows, I work on
  - [Sidequery](https://sidequery.dev/), a macOS (and soon cloud!) data analysis and visualization tool
  - [Sidemantic](https://github.com/sidequery/sidemantic), an complimentary semantic layer built for Sidequery. Supports metrics in LookML, MetricFlow, Cube, Superset, Rill, Omni & Hex formats
