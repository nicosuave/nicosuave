I lead engineering, data & product at [atm.com](https://atm.com). I also work on on data tools for [Sidequery](https://sidequery.dev).
  
- [sqlnb](https://sqlnb.app/)
  - a collaborative web & macOS data analysis and visualization tool with SQL notebooks & beautiful charts
    - Compatible with Claude Code, Codex CLI & Gemini CLI & your existing AI subscriptions
- [pynb](https://pynb.app)
  - a macOS native alterantive Python data notebook that is semi-compatible with Jupyter

_Making analysis more reliable for both humans and machines is my passion!_

#### Python Packages
