Professionally, I lead product & engineering at [atm.com](https://atm.com)

Personally, I work on data tools; some open source some closed source
  - [Sidequery](https://sidequery.dev/) a macOS (and soon cloud!) data analysis and visualization tool with SQL notebooks & beautiful charts
    - Compatible with Claude Code, Codex CLI & Gemini CLI & your existing subscriptions
  - [Sidemantic](https://github.com/sidequery/sidemantic) an complimentary semantic layer for Sidequery to define reusable metrics
    - Supports metrics in LookML, MetricFlow, Cube, Superset, Rill, Omni & Hex formats
